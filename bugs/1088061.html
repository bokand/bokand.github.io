<!-- 
In Chrome >= 83, attempting to edit the contenteditable span above results in 
unexpected behavior.

In prior versions, this CSS styling has been used to display placeholder text in a contenteditable
span when the span does not have focus.  Removed for simplicity is code that would clear the empty class
styling if the user were to add content to the span, eliminating the placeholder text.

Expected behavior:  A single click will place an active text cursor in the span and hide placeholder text.
The user would be able to edit text within the span. This works as expected in versions of Chrome prior to 83.

Actual behavior: On first click, the text disappears as usual, but no insertion point text cursor appears.
No text entry can be made into the span.

On second click, the expected cursor reappears and the span is editable.

If the user makes subsequent clicks on a blank span, the text will alternately appear and disappear, and ultimately after about 5 clicks,
the browser will crash with an 'Aw, Snap!' message and error code RESULT_CODE_UNINSTALL_USER_CANCEL.
